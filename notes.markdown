## TODO List

* <strike>Toggle scene - put it back to previous scene when button is hit again</strike>
* <strike>Scene dependent keys for toggling sources</strike>
* <strike>Make sure setScene promise is caught if there is an error</strike>
* <strike>Ability to hold button to change layouts</strike>
* Enable babel so we can use modules...  because old export syntax is gross
* Add redux as store
  * State gets confusing between modules and main file
* Set images for buttons
  * Using the jimp library
  * Make sure there are template pngs available to use
  * Make background colors configurable for both sides of toggle
  * Add text ... most likely need a 12 pt font to do it correctly
  * Genreate images on startup, add them to data structure
* Play sounds
  * Find a decent library that doesn't shell out
    * If it must shell out, at least have a way to cancel it
